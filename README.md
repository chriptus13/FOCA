# FOCA

FOCA (FOotball Chelas Application) is a web application built using data from [Football-Data](https://www.football-data.org/) API where users can register and create groups of their favorite football teams.

This project was developed in Programação na Internet (Web Developing) subject in [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt) during my degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering.

There were three phases in the project:

* [Phase 1](/parte1) => The objective was to implement the [REST API](/API_EndPoints.md) respecting the [pre-requisites](/PI-1819-1-Trab-P1.pdf)
* [Phase 2](/parte2) => The objective was to refactor all the code into the Promise or Async/Await idioms and use Express
* [Phase 3](/parte3) => The objective was to implement the front-end and add authentication in order for private user groups
